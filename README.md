# So what is this?
As part of an assignment during my study abroad, we were tasked with creating "water" in any form we wanted.
Taking an abstract approach, I created this 2D water simulation in Processing.

An initial set of water particles are generated at the start of the program. 
Then, by clicking or dragging on the screen, the user can add more particles to the set and watch the waves.
